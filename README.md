# NLP
In this repository I am going to address three different NLP exercises:

- Sentiment analysis trying to answer the following questions:
    * Which is the tone of the tweet? Positive or negative?
- Topic modeling.
    * What the presidents in the dataset talk about? What they talk about separately?
- Text generation.
    * Make a Trump bot that tweets like him does.
